<p>I will be doing constant outputs as part of the assignment, where I intend to work on my ideas for new coding projects and commit public code to Github for 13 weeks. It could be:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>(i) A working project I wanted to demo</em> or</p>
          <p><em>(ii) Idea for a new plugin or utility that I want to develop and publish as NPM Modules (or node.js library).</em></p>
          <q>In case of modules, the end project will be a package that anyone can install and use in their projects. I will also write a documentation explaining what it does and how others developers can use it on their projects.</q>
        </blockquote>
      <br />
        <p>I’ve been working on a quite a few side projects I am passionate about, but rarely had the time to complete and ship it. I couldn’t make adequate progress and was struggling to find the time to work on them back then I now take this opportunity to establish a long-term habit of launching projects and increase my pace to push code more regularly.</p>
        
        <p>To me, these side projects get my adrenaline going. Because I evolve myself in these side projects as it helps me explore and learn new things, delve deeper into a particular topic or framework and strengthen my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In addition, these passion project helped me choose the direction and the technologies I use. And it’s also been exciting to work on a new technology or different environment and that I can use these skills in other ways when the opportunities present itself.</p>
        
        <p>I love contributing towards open source projects, especially those I care about and benefit myself, and also collaborate with others to learn how open source community works.
I will also be exploring node.js more in-depth, which would help me become more efficient in building node modules.</p>
