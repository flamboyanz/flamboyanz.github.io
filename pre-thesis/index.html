							<p><strong>How brain thinks, learns and remembers things have intrigued <br />me time and time again.</strong></p>

							<ul>
								<li>Why Brain’s complexity and its immense ability to perform millions of things still remains a mystery?</li>
								<li>Is it possible to measure the cognitive ability of human brain? </li>
								<li>What’s the memory capacity of the human brain? How much amount of information or memory it can store?</li>
								<li>Is it possible to calculate the brain’s exact storage capacity? And using what unit of measurement?</li>
								<li>If the human life span were significantly extended in future, would human brain have enough memory to store everything or running out of space would be a problem?</li>
								<li>How much of our Brain do we use?</li>
								<li>Is it true that human beings use only 10% of their brain?</li>
								<li>How we think our brain works and how they actually do?</li>
								<li>Can we measure the processing power of the human brain?</li>
								<li>How clusters of neurons from the diverse regions of the brain collaborate to form consciousness</li>

							<h4><strong>Algorithms</strong></h4>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Algorithms are already all around us. Algorithms are what drives Google’s search engine. Algorithms are what power Netflix to figure out what we want to watch next, Amazon Alexa’s voice assistants, Tinder’s match-making, driverless cars, high-speed trading and an ever-growing number of services and technologies. </p>
							<p>After all, what makes Google or Facebook, one of the most valuable brands in the world isn’t the massive data. it’s the company’s most closely guarded secret, its algorithms.</p>
							<p>While algorithms have been essential in helping improve our lives, boost world’s economy and rapid advancements in science and technology, they also have inadvertently increased huge inequality in society. Biased algorithms are growing every day and neither the companies developing them nor the government is interested in addressing the problem.</p>
							<p>Virginia Eubanks, a political scientist and author of the book ‘Automating Inequality’ writes in her book, how using computers to decide who gets social services is hurting the poor. How some of these high-tech tools are making inequality worse with automated systems that control which neighborhoods get policed, which families attain needed resources, and who is investigated for fraud.</p>

							<ul >
								<li>How to identify and highlight algorithmic bias?</li>
								<li>How can we understand its social implications better?</li>
								<li>How to drive diversity and inclusiveness in today’s predictive decision-making tools?</li>
								<li>How can we bring more awareness about the negative impact of these automated systems?</li>
								<li>How modern algorithms can be used to level the playing field in education and offset the cutthroat competition?</li>
								<li>How can we use algorithm to empower </li>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Artificial Intelligence will affect everyone, everywhere. The past few years have seen rapid advances in AI and machine learning, with new technologies achieving dramatic improvements in technical performance.</p>
							<p>Where does this ultimately lead? Software that thinks and does. Cognitive software that predict people’s behavior? drive autonomous vehicles. Artificial intelligence.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>How do we build people centric AI systems?</li>
								<li>How can we build a marketplace for algorithms so that anyone can develop, sell and buy algorithms?</li>

								<h4><strong>APIs (Application Programming Interface</strong></h4>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p>API is an interface that lets one software program “talk” to another, exchanging data behind the scenes. APIs power much of what we do online. Startups and established companies alike are leveraging the technology to become a bigger part of our lives. APIs are all about sharing.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>How to harness the power of APIs for greater good or social causes</li>
									<li>How can we use APIs to help non-profit organizations to wider their impact</li>
									<li>How APIs can be used to build innovative social services</li>
