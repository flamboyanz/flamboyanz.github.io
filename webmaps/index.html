				<h2>Exploring Leaflet APIs</h2>
				<p>For the Week 1 assignment, I went through the Anatomy of a Web Map presentation and did an initial analysis of the raster
					tilesets and vector tileset. </p>

				<p>I also explored the different layering of webmaps such as data layer, content layer and feature layers. I started exploring
					the Leaflet library documentation to understand the Leaflet's basic APIs and properties such as zoom and attribution
					controls and basic layer types. I went through LatLng properties to better understand how to represents a geographical
					point with a certain latitude and longitude.</p>

				<p>I worked on setting up the development workflow for the assignment. I also created a github page and repository for the
					project assignment. I added required dependencies to the HTML page, and created a Leaflet map. I added the tile layer
					using Mapbox Streets tiles. To integrate tile layers, I also explored the Mapbox Maps API to know how to retrieve slippy
					maps for embedding and other project features and formats supported by Mapbox, such as GeoJSON.</p>

				<p>For the UI layer, I worked on integrating popup window and tooltip. Leaflet has a very handy shortcut to create and bind
					a popup to a marker point. For tooltip, I tested with two different interactivity - fixed and sticky tooltip</p>

				<h2>Feminist Data Visualization</h2>
				<p>The article on feminist data visualization presents the shortcomings in the data visualization and flaws in the modern
					techniques used by its practitioners. The author also recommends several design suggestions that point towards a feminist
					ethics and politics of data visualization.</p>

				<p>Despite new technologies available to visualize the data, there is not enough representation of people who can think
					critically about the politics and ethics of representation. The author points out, even when these data visualization
					does not represent the whole population, people accept charts as facts because they are generalized, scientific and
					seem to present an expert, neutral point of view. In some cases, there is no clear way to verify or authenticate the
					facts represented.</p>

				<p>Additionally, a section of the society such as oppressed groups including women, minorities, and others are systematically
					excluded from the knowledge and insight presented on these charts. This reinforces author’s point of view that it is
					necessary to acknowledge data visualization as one more powerful and flawed tool of oppression.</p>

				<p>Building upon the implication of this representation, the author highlights few design thoughts about feminist data visualization
					and ways to do more responsible representation such as (i) Introduce new ways to represent uncertainty and missing data
					that would substantiate fact-checking and verification in the process. (ii) Invent new ways to reference the material
					economy behind the data collection, such as the source: where, why and how the data was collected. </p>

				<p>Further, explore how to present alternate views and realities in the data visualization. imagine an alternate way to
					include more voices in the conversation, which is inclusive of dissent and contestation.</p>

				<h2>Final Project - Discovery Phase</h2>
				<p>I spent some time last week preparing for the final project and divided the project tasks into multiple phases namely
					discovery, data processing, prototyping and development.</p>

				<p>I began working on the discovery phase by exploring subjects and data sets that interested me most. One of the subject
					was the government spending. I was always interested to learn more about how various agencies in the government appropriated
					tax payer’s money.</p>

				<p>With this curiosity to see how this money was spent. I started researching on federal spending and pondering over some
					questions surrounding it, like what were some of the biggest spending, what were the top priorities during budget planning,
					ranging from key areas like social security, medicare, education and infrastructure to investments in science and technology.
					Further, how the fiscal spending was divided for all the U.S government agencies.</p>

				<p>More importantly, it will be interesting to see how these spending was distributed state-wide and how that impacted the
					demographic region. What was the role of the treasury and federal reserve in budget planning</p>

				<p>The goal is to study and understand the big picture of federal spending and its correlation with the geographic region.
					I also did some preliminary work on planning for data gathering and formats required for the visualization, including
					geo data. </p>

				<h2>City Wide Congested Corridors Project</h2>
				
				<p>In New York City, whether you commute by train, bus, or car, it seems like traffic is inevitable and no matter which route you look at. According to the new study by <a herf="http://inrix.com/scorecard/">INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard</a>, a data company dedicated to transportation and car services, New York City is the third most congested city in the world in terms of traffic and the second worst in the United States in the year 2017.</p>

				<p>INRIX reports that on average, driver waste 118 hours per year in congestion on the 4.7 mile stretch— an increase of 37 percent from the previous year. Additionally, New York drivers spent 13 percent of their time sitting in congestion, with 11 percent of that being attributed to daytime traffic. </p>

				<p>The study also highlights that New York is home to four of the 10 most congested roadways in the U.S. The Cross-Bronx Expressway (I-95) topped that list for the third straight year. The other corridors that made the list for worst in the country include East 34th Street from FDR Drive to Fifth Avenue, Belt Parkway East from exit 3 to exit 17, and East 42nd Street from FDR Drive to Seventh Avenue.</p>

				<p>INRIX study found that the traffic cost New York City nearly $34 billion last year — nearly $3,000 per driver — in wasted time, fuel and traffic-related fees. That's the biggest economic toll of any U.S. city by far.</p>

				<p>After going through this report, I was curious to explore some of these corridors and understand what could be the cause for this magnitude of traffic in these particular areas. I started collecting and analyzing publicly available transportation dataset by the city government and ride hailing companies.</p>

				<p>With city taxis as the major contributor to the traffic wows, I was interested to figure out what are some of the key factors that impacted the congestion, like where those taxi trips are coming from, where they concentrated during peak hours. If those new trips were originating in central and lower Manhattan, the region’s congested core. What about the traffic congestions in the outer boroughs? Which street intersections suffered most congestions in the five boroughs.</p>

				<p>
					The primary source for the research was the dataset released by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). The TLC dataset has captured a staggering 1.1 billion individual taxi trips in the city from January 2009 through June 2015. Its highly detailed and more than just a vast list of taxi pickup and drop off coordinates. It captured several other fields ranging from trip distance, fare amount, taxi zone location, payment type and city tax collected per trip.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the further analysis of the TLC data, I used the Goole BigQuery tool. It’s a quite useful tool when it comes to querying a massive datasets like the TLC data. BigQuery is a cloud based data warehouse tool that helps query large datasets with fast SQL queries by running a web query or making calls to their REST API.
				</p>

				<p>
					I was interested to map the coordinates of the trip data in a 3D map and simulate the taxi trails as paths and vertices rendered in motion. I wanted to build a map and project it with 3D buildings and extrusions to display the building heights in the neighborhood. It would enhance the richness of the trail motions and also help get a real-time sense of the moving traffic in a 3D perspective. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I filtered the dataset for yellow and green cabs, and combined it with FHV (For Hire Vehicles) data. I tested with different time scales to come up with the right epoch suitable for the motion trail and optimized for better performance. I extracted the dataset for the trips taken from June 16, 2016 21:00 to 21:30. I also added the timeline loop for the motion animation.
				</p>

				<p>
					I used Mapbox, an open source JavaScript library to create custom designed maps and add rich interactivity through multiple layers superimposed on it. I downloaded the building geometry data of lower Manhattan from OpenStreetMap, another open data source useful for mapping information. I also used React.js library and JavaScript ES6 features to build the front-end components and add user interactions.
				</p>

				<p>
					I used Mapbox’s FlyToInterpolator API to navigate to the busiest intersections, and the busiest streets can be inferred from the intersections.
				</p>

				<p>
					The congestion also has a huge price on the economy of the city. Traffic congestion will be a $100 billion drag on the New York metro area economy over the next five years unless something is done to discourage cars and trucks from crowding the streets and highways of the region during the busiest times of the day, according to another study conducted by HDR for the Partnership for New York City. 
				</p>

				<p>Visualizing a 3D map in this case would help effectively identify several key factors affecting the congestions:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Examine current and future transportation conditions.</li>
					<li>Identify existing and future corridor for traffic congestions, and their impacts on the surrounding neighborhood.</li>
					<li></li>Reduce the time needed to travel to and within the corridor.</li>
					<li>Improve safety and mobility for pedestrians, cyclists, transit users and motorists.</li>
					<li>Assess parking and safety issues in these zones.</li>
					<li>Collect live ridership data and intermodal connections.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The research company published this study amid a statewide debate over a congestion pricing scheme for New York City. A commission impaneled by the government recommended tolling cars to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, along with other measures, to improve traffic in the city's center and fund repairs to the subway system.</p>
