            <h2>Exploring Leaflet APIs</h2>
            <p>For the Week 1 assignment, I went through the Anatomy of a Web Map presentation and did an initial analysis of the raster tilesets and vector tileset. </p>

            <p>I also explored the different layering of webmaps such as data layer, content layer and feature layers. I started exploring the Leaflet library documentation to understand the Leaflet's basic APIs and properties such as zoom and attribution controls and basic layer types. I went through LatLng properties to better understand how to represents a geographical point with a certain latitude and longitude.</p>

            <p>I worked on setting up the development workflow for the assignment. I also created a github page and repository for the project assignment. I added required dependencies to the HTML page, and created a Leaflet map. I added the tile layer using Mapbox Streets tiles. To integrate tile layers, I also explored the Mapbox Maps API to know how to retrieve slippy maps for embedding and other project features and formats supported by Mapbox, such as GeoJSON.</p>

            <p>For the UI layer, I worked on integrating popup window and tooltip. Leaflet has a very handy shortcut to create and bind a popup to a marker point. For tooltip, I tested with two different interactivity - fixed and sticky tooltip</p>
            <p>I also added buttons (below the map) to enable panning the map view to different cities using LatLng values. The LatLng values holds the coordinates of the latitutde and longitudes of the cities</p>
