      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>This week I worked on developing visualization to project list of  largest cities in the United States by crime rate based on 2009 statistics. I’ used the data set available from NYC OpenData and provided by the Office of the Mayor (OTM).</p>
      <p>I sorted the initial dataset by crime rare volume and filtered out non essential attributes in order to sanitize and keep the required fields. The main attributes are list of cities, crime rates and crime index ranking.</p>
      <p>I also experimented with the style and presentation for the visualization format. I have also used GIS data for neighborhood labels and information as depicted in the New York city map.</p>

       <br />
      <p>Diego talks about the everyday objects he uses on a daily basis namely, Mitsubishi pen, Cardigan sweatshirt and Moeleskine notebook. He articulates how useful they are for his productivity and supplements his lifestyle, especially Moleskine notebook to jot down notes and scribble project ideas. If you’re going to consistently come up with ideas to write about or do something with, you have to be able to capture them regardless of when they show up. So it's definetly an important tool for collecting ideas and keep log of action items in our lives</p>

She also used it to print photos of her family members who live far away in her hometown. Yueting loves fashion and has a large collection of fashion magazines. They serve as great source of inspiration for her work to draw different ideas and interesting designss.s</p>

            <p>Geoffrey Hinton is known as the godfather of the artificial intelligence field called neural networks or "neural nets,". His research group in Toronto made major breakthroughs in deep learning that have revolutionized speech recognition and object classification. It involves setting up computer systems to mimic the human brain, allowing them to learn.e</p>
    
            <p>I am interestesd to learn about his research on aritificial neural networks and his successfull attempt to get computers to learn like people do</p>

            <p>Christopher Nolan is a film director and screenwriter. He is a talented film maker and aclaimed for his noirish visual aesthetic and unconventional storytelling. His body of work include movies like Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and Memento.</p>
            <p>I am interested to explore his style of storytelling, narrative and the visual aesthetics he incorporates in his movies. It will be interesting to know what influenced the visual style as the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings, and real filming locations over studio world.</p>

      <p>For the constant output task, I am interested in working on passion projects as part of constant input or output. The project idea is to create a data visualization using interesting datasets and host it online. I have selected a monthly schedule for this project. I will post the project in my process website. I will also post regular update explaining the idea and the dataset I worked on in my website.

          <p><em>Response to the Week 1 article</em></p>
          <h4>Sketching: the Visual Thinking Power Tool</h4>
          <p>Sketching is integral part of the design process. It is also fun and enjoyably, it allows anyone to be flexible, explore new ideas, think outside the box and experiment with various ideas. I can resonate with the use of sketching as an imaginative tool and conceptualize different ideas. I derive great value from trying my best to lay things out.</p>
          <p>Some books worth mentioning is Drawing on the Artist Within and Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, by Betty Edwards. It’s a great book and details about the sketching process . The idea of gesture drawing helps loosen my tightly clenched grip on the pencil.</p>

          <h4>The Miseducation of the Doodle</h4>
          <p>I have always been inspired by doodling. It has helped me come up with new ideas. Doodling is a thinking tool that can help stay focussed and spark new creativity. I always believed people who doodle are often better at grasping new concepts and staying focused, refine new creative ideas by means of pen and paper. Lot of artists and designers I know are avid doodlers, scribbling in their free time and during conversations, classes and meetings.
          </p>
          <p>The article highlights tremendous benefits of doodling, and how it can help myriads of functions that result in thinking such as increase our ability to focus, creative problem solving skills, increase information retrieval etc.The article also suggests different methods of doodling, including group doodle activity that aids participatory design and co-creations.</p>
